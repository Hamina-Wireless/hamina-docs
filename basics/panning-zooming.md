# ðŸ—º Panning and Zooming Maps

Being able to quickly zoom in, zoom out, and pan around maps is key to being a fast and efficient network designer. For example, you may need to zoom in to precisely place the start of a wall, quickly pan to another part of the map, place the end of the wall, and then zoom out to see where to draw walls next. We recommend exercising the zoom and pan controls often throughout the design process.

## Trackpad and Mouse Modes

Hamina Network Planner offers optimized zoom and pan controls for both trackpads and standard mice with scroll wheels. You can instantly switch modes with the **Switch to mouse/trackpad mode** button in the camera toolbar on the right.

To pan the map:

* **Trackpad**: Scroll the map in any direction with two fingers on the trackpad.
* **Apple Magic Mouse**: Scroll the map in any direction with one finger on the touch surface on the top of the mouse.
* **Keyboard + mouse**: Hold the space bar, and move the mouse. Release the space bar to stop panning.

To zoom in and out:

* Pinch to zoom in and out.
* **(macOS)**: Hold down the **âŒ˜** key, and two-finger scroll the mouse.
* **(Windows)**: Hold down the **Ctrl** key, and two-finger scroll the mouse.

### Mouse Mode

To pan the map:

* **Mouse**: Drag the map with the middle or right mouse button.
* **Keyboard + mouse**: Hold the space bar, and move the mouse. Release the space bar to stop panning.

To zoom in and out:

* Roll the scroll wheel forwards or backwards.
