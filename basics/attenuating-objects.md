# ðŸ“¦ Attenuating Objects

Attenuating Objects are similar to walls in that they create obstacles that reduce signal strength in Hamina. Walls are thin, and knock down signal strength by a pre-determined amount (depending on the wall profile). Attenuating Objects, on the other hand, knock down signal strength depending on how far the signal travels through the object. This makes Attenuating Objects much more suitable for modeling things like warehouse shelving, large machinery, or any other semi-solid non-wall objects.

Use Attenuating Objects to model large obstacles. Don't worry about smaller objects like furniture.

## Drawing Attenuating Objects

### Rectangles

With the left mouse button, click and drag from one corner of the object to the opposite corner, and release the mouse button.

### Free-Form Attenuating Objects

1. Much like drawing walls, **right-click** to begin drawing the attenuating object.
2. **Left-click** to create each node.
3. When the final node has been placed, **right-click** to stop drawing and complete the attenuating object.

While drawing attenuating objects, hold down the `space` bar and move the mouse to pan! Since this panning method doesn't require any mouse clicks, it works great during drawing.

### Adding or Modifying Attenuating Object Profiles

With the Attenuating Objects tool activated, the Attenuating Object pane will appear on the right. Click the **Add or Modify** button at the bottom.

The Attenuating Object Editor window will appear. From here, you can:

* Edit existing objects (click on the profile to edit it)
* Duplicate object profiles to create your own (click the **Duplicate** button in the object profile)
* Create your own (click the Add a custom wall button)

{% hint style="info" %}
Editing objects only affect the profiles in the project. Your other projects (and any new projects that you create) will be completely unaffected.
