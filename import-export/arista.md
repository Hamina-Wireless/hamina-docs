# üÖ∞Ô∏è Arista

Hamina Network Planner includes integration with Arista, which can be used for Import, Export, and Live View (which is currently available as a <mark style="color:red;">**Feature Preview**</mark>) purposes.&#x20;

The **Import** function will bring the map, scale, and access points (including model, name, MAC, serial, transmit power, channel, and channel width settings) into Hamina Network Planner. Then, you can add walls, attenuating objects, and scope zones to simulate the current Arista network configuration in a predictive model.

The **Export** function rapidly deploys a new site, or updates an existing site directly from Hamina Network Planner. This removes the need for any repeat map-based deployment work - all of the mapping work is automatically copied directly from Hamina Network Planner.
