# üß¨ Cisco Catalyst Center

Hamina Network Planner can export the network design as a file that can be imported to Cisco DNA Center (formerly known as Cisco DNA Center or "DNAC").

{% hint style="danger" %}
This feature is currently in development, and is only available in Hamina Network Planner as a <mark style="color:red;">**Feature Preview**</mark>. It probably won't work at all, but feel free to give it a try if you're interested.
{% endhint %}
