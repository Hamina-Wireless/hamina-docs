# ðŸ”‘ Accounts and Licenses

## Users

In Hamina Wireless products, a user is defined as an individual person. Each user needs to have their own subscription. Subscriptions for teams can be provided through a volume license key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Shared accounts, group accounts, and login sharing are not permitted per our Terms of Service. Each user must create a unique, named account.

For details, check out our [Terms of Service](https://www.hamina.com/terms).
{% endhint %}

Whether you are trying out Hamina, or activating a new subscription, here's how to activate your license. This applies to both Hamina Network Planner, and Hamina Onsite.

3. If you have a subscription with multiple seats, and have any colleagues who need to activate it, use the **Copy license key** option in the **... menu** to retrieve it to share with them.

## Volume License Keys

If you have a team of two or more users, you can purchase multiple licenses from a single account. This is often useful for simplifying billing.

### Retrieving the License Key

If you purchase multiple licenses, you'll need to retrieve the license key from Hamina, and share it with anyone that you'd like to add to your Hamina organization.

1. Click on the **Account Menu** in the upper right.
