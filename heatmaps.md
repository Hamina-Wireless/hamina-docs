# ðŸ”¥ Heatmaps

## Managing Heatmaps

Access heatmap options by clicking on the Heatmap drop-down menu at the top of Hamina. You can choose the Technology, Heatmap, and Band (for Wi-Fi).

## Heatmaps

### Wi-Fi

* **Coverage**: Shows signal strength from the loudest access point.
* S**econdary coverage**: Shows signal strength from the second loudest access point, which helps ensure that there are always at least two access points above a certain signal strength threshold. Important for redundancy and smooth roaming performance.
* **Tertiary coverage**: Shows signal strength from the third loudest access point, which helps ensure that there are always at least three access points above a certain signal strength threshold. Primary used for Wi-Fi-based real-time location services.
* **SNR**: The Signal-to-noise Ratio shows how much signal strength there is above the noise floor.
* **Interference**: Shows how much co-channel interference is occurring.
* **Data rate**: Shows the theoretical maximum data rate available, based on on the SNR.
