# ðŸ—º Panning and Zooming Maps

Being able to quickly zoom in, zoom out, and pan around maps is key to being a fast and efficient network designer. For example, you may need to zoom in to precisely place the start of a wall, quickly pan to another part of the map, place the end of the wall, and then zoom out to see where to draw walls next. We recommend exercising the zoom and pan controls often throughout the design process.

## Panning Maps

* **With the mouse and keyboard**: Hold the space bar, and move the mouse. Release the space bar to stop panning (recommended).
* **With a trackpad**: Scroll the map in any direction with two fingers on the trackpad.
* **With an Apple Magic Mouse**: Scroll the map in any direction with one finger on the touch surface on the top of the mouse.
* **With a standard mouse**: Middle-click or right-click and drag the map with the mouse cursor (not recommended).

{% hint style="info" %}
The standard mouse method isn't recommended, as it interferes with drawing walls and areas, which use the right mouse button.
{% endhint %}

## Zooming Maps

* **With the mouse and keyboard (Windows)**: Hold down the **Ctrl** key, and scroll the mouse (recommended).
* **With the mouse and keyboard (macOS)**: Hold down the **âŒ˜** key, and scroll the mouse (recommended).
* **With a trackpad**: Pinch to zoom in and out.
* **With a keyboard**: Press the **+** and **-** keys on the keyboard to zoom in and out.
