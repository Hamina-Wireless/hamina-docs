### There's black artifacts all over my heatmaps. What's going on?

Hamina Network Planner takes full advantage of your 3D graphics accelerator to draw heatmaps. As a result, support for hardware acceleration must be enabled in your browser.

{% hint style="success" %}
These instructions are for Google Chrome, but the process of enabling hardware acceleration is very similar in most browsers.
{% endhint %}

1. In the upper right corner of your browser, click on the **hamburge**r (three dot) menu.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. The **Settings tab** will appear. Towards the bottom of the Settings menu on the left, select **System**.
4. Enable **Use graphics acceleration when available**.
