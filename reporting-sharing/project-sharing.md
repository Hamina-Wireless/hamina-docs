# ü§ù Project Sharing

## Share a Project

To invite other Hamina users to a project, click on the Share button in the upper right.

<div align="left">

</div>

Enter the email address(es) of the Hamina users that you wish to share the project. For multiple recipients, separate each email address with a comma.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
The EU and US instances of Hamina are completely separate. Hamina user accounts, and project data only exists on one instance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Invited users will receive an email notification asking them to approve invite. Once approved, they will have access to the project. They will be able to modify the project based on their individual Hamina Network Planner subscription status.&#x20;

## Moving Projects to Other Accounts

Using the Project Sharing and Project Duplication tools, you can move projects to another account.

{% hint style="info" %}
While these instructions show how to move one project at a time, you can perform each step for all of your projects to batch the tasks, and speed up the process.
{% endhint %}

1.  In the source account, invite the target account to share the project with the **Share** button in the upper right.\


    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/invite.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
2.  The target account will receive both an email and a notification in Hamina Network Planner where the project can be accepted. In Hamina Network Planner, accept the project in the target account with the **Notification** button in the upper right, and the **Approve** button.\

    </div>
3.  The project is still owned by the source account, so make a duplicate of it in the **Project** list with the **Duplicate** option.\


    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/duplicate.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
4.  Optionally rename the duplicated project in the target account in the **Project** list in the **Settings** option.\


    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/settings.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
5. Optionally, remove the old project from the source account.
