The online, interactive report is essentially a read-only version of Hamina, with full panning, zooming, and interactivity. The report viewer doesn't need a Hamina account or license - they only need a link to the report (and a password, if you choose to password-protect it).

### Reporting Tab Overview

The Reporting Tab has several sections:

1. **Generate PDF** - Generate and download a static PDF version of the report.
2. **Share Link** - Customize and create a link to a live, interactive, web-based version of the report.
3. **Pages** - Switch between different pages of the report, and hide/show pages to deliver the relevant content to whoever will view the report.
4. **Page Title and Description** - Customize the title and description of each page in the report. Changing the title here will also change it in the Pages column.

### Online Reports

Online Reports in Hamina Network Planner provide your managers, customers, and project stakeholders with a fully interactive, read-only Hamina Network Planner interface. The user interface is very similar to Hamina Network Planner, except there are no tools, and the report viewer can navigate between heatmaps and views with a simple menu.&#x20;

The heatmaps and views that the user sees are determined by which pages you show and hide.

{% hint style="info" %}
Whenever the Online Report is loaded or refreshed, it shows the most recent version of the project, so the documentation is never out of date.
{% endhint %}

#### Sharing an Online Report

To share an Online Report, click the blue **Share** button in the upper right. Next, you'll have the option to create a password for the report. Click the **Create links** button to create a link.

The report will be available as long as the report exists. You can click the red **Revoke links** button to make the report no longer accessible.

### PDF Reports

If the customer requires a physical deliverable, you can generate a PDF report with the **Download** button in the upper right. Select **Generate PDF** to begin the report generation progress, at which point you will see a progress indicator. When the report has finished generating on the Hamina Cloud, the **Download PDF** button will become available.

{% hint style="info" %}
Per Hamina account, only one PDF Report can be generated at a time. You won't be able to start generating a new PDF report until the previous report is finished generating.
{% endhint %}
