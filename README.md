# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## Create an Account

To create an account, visit the Hamina instance that is the closest to you.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The EU and US instances of Hamina are completely separate. Your user account, subscription status, and project data will only exist on one instance. Be sure to choose the correct instance at the time of account creation.
{% endhint %}

### Hamina Instances

* ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU Instance: [https://eu.hamina.com/](https://eu.hamina.com/)

## Create Your First Project

The first time you launch Hamina, it will prompt you to name and save a project.

## Upload a Floor Plan

After naming and saving your first project, Hamina will prompt you to either upload a floor plan, or add some notes to the project. You can do either of these at a later time, but most users start with a floor plan.

Supported image types:

* PNG
* JPEG
* PDF
* DWG
* DXF
* TIFF&#x20;
* WEBP

## Subscribe to Hamina Network Planner

If this is the first time you've logged into Hamina Network Planner, then you probably don't have a subscription yet. Without a subscription, you can't design networks in Hamina, but you can still do a few things like:

* Add project notes
* Add floor plans
* Set the scale
* Create in/out of scope zones
* Add map notes
* Use the client view
* Invite others to collaborate on your project

If you don't have a subscription, you won't be able to:

* Select the Edit tool
* Draw walls or attenuating objects
* Place or move access points
* Place or move switches or PoE clients
* Create new reports
* Open previous reports
* Retrieve existing online report sharing links
* View or edit the Bill of Materials

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a wireless network engineer or designer, then the "free mode" in Hamina probably isn't for you. That said, it will come in handy for sharing projects with your sales team, or customers who want a "read-only" view of your work in Hamina.
