# 🗒 Release Notes

### 2023/09/01

* The Auto-draw walls tool has been hugely improved! It now draws less segments, and straighter walls.
* New accounts now include five sample projects, so new users can immediately see what the tool is capable of, and start moving APs around. 🎉
* In addition to the new sample accounts, there is now a 15-minute tutorial video. 📺
* In the Auto-draw walls tool, you can now click on a wall layer, and assign a material to it with a hotkey. ⌨️
* When sharing a project with another Hamina Network Planner user, you can now type in their address and hit Enter (without having to click on the Share button).
* The scale marker in the lower left wasn’t working correctly with feet, although it was fine in meters. We beat feet and got it fixed. 🏃
