# 🗒 Release Notes

### 2023/09/07

* If the heatmap is set to None, placing the first AP on the map automatically turns on the primary coverage heatmap for that type of AP (Wi-Fi, Private Cellular, BLE, or Zigbee)! 🔥
* Previously, the pin icon for private cellular base stations used a “5G” icon, which didn’t make sense for base stations that were 4G. We switched it to a generic  “cellular bars” icon to make it more universal. 📶
* Consumer routers and customer-premise equipment is now “on the table” in Network Planner, with the all-new “Table Mount” option. 🍽️
* Fixed a bug where all APs in PDF would be blue, no matter what. Now, alternate AP colors appear in PDF reports. 🗒️
* Previously in 3D, the lines from the client view tracked back to the floor underneath the AP. Now, the lines terminate at the height of the AP, which is nice for seeing if the client has line-of-sight through sloped floors and attenuating objects.

### 2023/09/01

* The Auto-draw walls tool has been hugely improved! It now draws less segments, and straighter walls.
* New accounts now include five sample projects, so new users can immediately see what the tool is capable of, and start moving APs around. 🎉
* In addition to the new sample accounts, there is now a 15-minute tutorial video. 📺
* In the Auto-draw walls tool, you can now click on a wall layer, and assign a material to it with a hotkey. ⌨️
* When sharing a project with another Hamina Network Planner user, you can now type in their address and hit Enter (without having to click on the Share button).
* The scale marker in the lower left wasn’t working correctly with feet, although it was fine in meters. We beat feet and got it fixed. 🏃
