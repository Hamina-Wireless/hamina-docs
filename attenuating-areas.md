# ðŸ“¦ Attenuating Objects

Attenuating Objects are similar to walls in that they create obstacles that reduce signal strength in Hamina. Walls are thin, and knock down signal strength by a pre-determined amount (depending on the wall profile). Attenuating Objects, on the other hand, knock down signal strength depending on how far the signal travels through the object. This makes Attenuating Objects much more suitable for modeling things like warehouse shelving, large machinery, or any other semi-solid non-wall objects.

Use Attenuating Objects to model large obstacles. Don't worry about smaller objects like furniture.

## Drawing Attenuating Objects

### Rectangles

With the left mouse button, click and drag from one corner of the object to the opposite corner, and release the mouse button.

### Complex Shapes

1. Much like drawing walls, **right-click** to begin drawing the attenuating object.
2. **Left-click** to create each node.
3. When the final node has been placed, **right-click** to stop drawing and complete the attenuating object.
